# BigInteger-Class-Java

## 1. Project Overview:
- This project involves creating a custom BigInteger class in Java to handle large integers beyond the capacity of primitive data types like 'int' or 'long'.
- The class supports basic arithmetic operations, and ensures that large numbers are accurately processed and represented.

## 2. Key Concepts Used:
#### a. Object-Oriented Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are used to design the classes and objects in the program.
#### b. Method Overloading & Overriding
#### c. Constructors (Parameterized & Non-parameterized)
#### d. String Manipulation & StringBuilder Class
#### e. Validation Logic
- Ensures the integrity of the project and prevents invalid data from being stored or processed.

## 3. Tasks Performed:
- Successfully able to compute basic arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division - quotient + remainder, comparison, etc) on large integers.
